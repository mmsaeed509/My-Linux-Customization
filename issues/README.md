#### kernel issue 

![](v-box/kernel-vbox.png)

> :warning: **make sure you install the right kernel modules**
> `virtualbox-host-dkms` or `virtualbox-host-modules-arch` [read](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VirtualBox#Installation_steps_for_Arch_Linux_hosts)

in my case `virtualbox-host-dkms` is the right kernel modules

open up the terminal execute this command 
```bash 
sudo vboxreload
```
